2008-09-26 - YubiPAM 1.0.4
  [*] Improvements
      * PAM. A small bug crept in with the introduction of yk_chkpwd. Use of
        the pam_syslog function is apparently privvy to more recent systems.
        The appropriate checks are now in place. - thanks Brian Gorka


2008-09-24 - YubiPAM 1.0.3
  [*] Improvements
      * yk_chkpwd. A new binary has been added to ensure complete usability
        for all users. It was discovered that certain applications, such as
        gnome-screensaver, with restricted privileges could not access the
        Yubikey database. The new helper, akin to that of pam_unix, ensures
        that the Yubikey database is readily accessible to these processes for
		authentication. - thanks Geoff Hoff
	
      * ykvalidate. Updates to the calling and using the new helper binary
        allows for more intuitive usage of this binary.

      * PAM. The default settings for echoing of the Yubikey OTP is now set to
        silent, with verbose OTPs requiring the "verbose_otp" flag set int the
        configuration file. Given that it is a "One Time" pad which will not be
        used again, it merely follows the best practices of other non-OTP
        configurations.


2008-09-08 - YubiPAM 1.0.2
  [*] Improvements
      * PAM. Fixed an issue when stacking YubiPAM with other modules. When
        YubiPAM was stacked after another module it would retrieve the 
        authentication token from the preceding module and assume that as the
        OTP when clearly it wasn't. - thanks Brian Gorka

      * Documentation. Added clearer documentation on building and debugging
        the YubiPAM code.


2008-09-03 - YubiPAM 1.0.1
  [*] Improvements
      * ykpasswd. Added additional flags to ease administration of inserting
        to the database. The minimal flags now require adding a valid OTP and
        it's corresponding AES key.


2008-08-03 - YubiPAM 1.0
  [*] Initial Release
      * Manual add/delete from database. Using the ykpasswd tool you can add 
	    delete yubikey entries from the database (default: /etc/yubikey).

      * Per user accounting. Supports indiviudal user account authorisation.
	    This is currently limited to one Yubikey dongle per user account.

	  * Single factor sign in. Currently only single factor (ie. Yubikey OTP)
	    is currently supported. There will be an additional second factor
		password option added in the near future.
		
	  * Static heuristic support. Heuristic support for OTP data deltas is hard
	    coded. This will be changable in the next minor release.
