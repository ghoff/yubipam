1. YubiPAM Quick Install
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "generic" notes for putting this thing together are below.  Here's the
short version.

The quick install notes for getting people up and running in with minimal fuss
are below. Detailed instructions will follow later.

1.   *** Make sure you have PAM library HEADERS installed!!! ***
2.   ./configure
3.   make
4.   make install
5.   addgroup yubiauth
6.   touch /etc/yubikey
7.   chgrp yubiauth /etc/yubikey /sbin/yk_chkpwd
8.   chmod g+rw /etc/yubikey
9.   chmod g+s /sbin/yk_chkpwd
10.  update the appropriate /etc/pam.d/* file (see README)
11.  Have fun!

2. YubiPAM Configure-time switches
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`--enable-debug'
    Enable debugging options (bugreports and developers only).
     
`--with-authdb=DIR'
	Select the default authentication database (default: /etc/yubikey).

`--with-pam-lib=DIR'
    Where to install the PAM library module (default: /lib/security)

3. Detailed Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are generic installation instructions.

The 'configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for various
system-dependent variables used during compilation. It uses those values to
create a 'Makefile' in each directory of the package. It may also create one or
more '.h' files containing system-dependent definitions. Finally, it creates a
shell script 'config.status' that you can run in the future to recreate the
current configuration, a file 'config.cache' that saves the results of its
tests to speed up reconfiguring, and a file 'config.log' containing compiler
output (useful mainly for debugging 'configure').

If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try to figure
out how 'configure' could check whether to do them, and mail diffs or
instructions to the address given in the 'README' so they can be considered for
the next release. If at some point 'config.cache' contains results you don't
want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

The file 'configure.in' is used to create 'configure' by a program called 
'autoconf'. You only need `configure.in' if you want to change it or regenerate
'configure' using a newer version of 'autoconf'. 

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  As a normal user:

  1.  "cd" to the directory containing the package's source code and type
      "./configure" to configure the package for your system.  If you're
      using "csh" on an old version of System V, you might need to type
      "sh ./configure" instead to prevent "csh" from trying to execute
      "configure" itself.

      Running "configure" takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
      messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2.  Type "make" to compile the package.

  3.  Optionally, type "make check" to run any self-tests that come with
      the package.

  As the root user:

  4.  Type "make install" to install the programs and any data files and
      documentation.

  5.  Add the YubiPAM authority group with "addgroup yubiauth".

  6.  Touch the database file with "touch /etc/yubikey" in the event it has
      not yet been created.

  7.  Change the groups of "/etc/yubikey" and "/sbin/yk_chkpwd" to allow
      unified editing of the database with 
	  "chgrp yubiauth /etc/yubikey /sbin/yk_chkpwd"

  8.  chmod g+rw /etc/yubikey

  9.  chmod g+s /sbin/yk_chkpwd

  10. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
      source code directory by typing "make clean".  To also remove the
      files that "configure" created (so you can compile the package for
      a different kind of computer), type "make distclean".  There is
      also a "make maintainer-clean" target, but that is intended mainly
      for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
      all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
      with the distribution.
